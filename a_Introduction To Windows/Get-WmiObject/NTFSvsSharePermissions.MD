# **NTFS (New Technology File System) and share permissions**
- are two different types of permissions that can be used to control access to files and folders on a Windows-based computer.

- NTFS permissions are applied to files and folders stored on an NTFS-formatted volume and are used to control access at the file and folder level. They allow for very granular control over who can access files and folders, and what actions they can perform on them.

- Share permissions, on the other hand, are applied when a folder is shared over a network. They are used to control access to the shared folder and its contents over the network. Share permissions are more basic and less granular than NTFS permissions and are typically used in conjunction with NTFS permissions to provide additional security.

    - The phrase "They allow for very granular control" means that NTFS permissions provide a high level of specificity and precision in terms of who can access files and folders and what actions they can perform. This means that you can set permissions for specific users or groups, and define exactly what they can do (such as read, write, execute, etc.) with the files and folders in question. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization in controlling access to files and folders on an NTFS-formatted volume.

- It is important to note that when both NTFS and share permissions are in effect, the most restrictive permission will be applied.

# **SMBv1**
___

 - SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications on a computer to read and write to files and to request services from server programs in a computer network. 
 
 - The Server Message Block protocol (SMB) is used in Windows to connect shared resources like files and printers. It is used in large, medium, and small enterprise environments. See the image below to visualize this concept:

 ![smb](../Get-WmiObject/Images/smb.PNG)
 
 
 
 - SMBv1 is version 1 of the SMB protocol. It was first introduced in the 1980s and was widely used in Windows operating systems up until Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.

- SMBv1 is known to have security vulnerabilities, such as the EternalBlue exploit, which was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. Due to these security issues, Microsoft has recommended disabling SMBv1 on all systems to prevent potential security breaches. They have also released later versions of SMB protocol to address the vulnerabilities found in SMBv1.
