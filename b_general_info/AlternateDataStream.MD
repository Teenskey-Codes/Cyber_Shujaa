### ALTERNATE DATA STREAM

- NTFS is a very good system however it has its shortcomings: Security Flaws.

- Alternate Data Stream

- An Alternate Data Stream, or ADS, is a way to store extra information on a computer file, beyond the main data that is stored in the file. Imagine you have a picture on your computer, and you want to store some extra information about the picture, like when it was taken or who took it. With ADS, you can store that extra information as a separate "stream" of data, which is attached to the picture file.

- Think of it as a way to attach a note to a picture file. The note does not change the picture file itself, and it is hidden away from the regular view when you open the file. However, if you know how to access it, you can view the note and all the extra information stored in that stream.

- In short, Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a way to store additional information within a file or folder that can be hidden.

- In short too: Without changing the file size we can add data unto it
