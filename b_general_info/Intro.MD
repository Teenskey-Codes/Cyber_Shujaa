#### What NFTS is:

- NTFS (New Technology File System) is a file system used by the Windows operating system to organize and store files on a computer's hard drive. It's the default file system for Windows operating system, it was introduced as a replacement for the older FAT (File Allocation Table) file system. NTFS is more advanced and efficient than FAT, it can handle larger amounts of data, has improved security features, and allows for more efficient organization of files. It supports advanced features such as data compression and encryption, and it also has better support for larger hard drives. It also has better disk quota and disk usage reporting. In simpler terms, NTFS is a way for Windows to organize and keep track of all the files on your computer, it's faster and more secure than the older system and allows you to do more with your files.

- File system - is the logical architecture of data stored and used by the OS.

- It is concerned with how the the OS manages and stores the data.

- There are many file systems example FAT32:

1. NTFS (New Technology File System): This is the default file system for Windows operating systems, and it provides advanced features like file and folder permissions, encryption, and large file support.

- Data Compression
- Persmissions and Security
- Encryption

- NTFS allows permission when say for instance
  a. Create a folder
  b. cd into the folder and create a file
  c. Move out of the folder and right click
  d. Navigate to the properties selection
  e. On the properties navigate to the security tab
  f. From the security tab you can give permissions over users
  g. You can also add a user.

  - The file system allows us to set permission controls

2. FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32-bit): This is an older file system that was commonly used on older versions of Windows, as well as on other operating systems like DOS and Linux. It has a smaller file size limit compared to NTFS and lack of some features
- Max partition size of 2TB
- File Size Limited to 4GB

3. exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table): This file system is designed for use on removable media, like flash drives and SD cards. It has a larger file size limit than FAT32, but is not as advanced as NTFS.


4. ReFS (Resilient File System): A newer file system, introduced in Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8. It is designed for high-availability storage scenarios and virtualized environments, it includes features such as integrity checking, self-healing and so on.
