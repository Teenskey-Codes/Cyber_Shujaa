##  **WHAT ARE TOPOLOGIES:**
___

- A topology in networking refers to the physical and logical layout of the devices and connections on a network.
___
## **COMMON TYPOLOGIES**
___
1. Star topology: all devices connect to a central hub or switch. It is easy to set up, expand and troubleshoot.
2. Bus topology: all devices connect to a single linear cable, it is simple and inexpensive but if the main cable breaks the entire network goes down.
3. Ring topology: all devices connect to each other in a circular configuration. It is efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization and it also provides a high degree of fault tolerance.
4. Mesh topology: all devices connect to multiple other devices, forming multiple paths for data to travel. It is highly reliable and fault-tolerant but it can be expensive to set up and manage.
4. Tree topology: it is a combination of bus and star topologies, with a central hub connecting to multiple other hubs. It is suitable for large networks and it allows for easy expansion.
5. Hybrid topology: it is a combination of different topologies, it is designed to take advantage of the strengths of multiple topologies and to overcome their weaknesses.

## **VPN**
__
- VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that allows users to securely connect to a private network over the internet.
- VPNs use encryption to secure the connection and protect data from unauthorized access.
- VPNs can be used to access restricted content, hide IP address and location, and protect against cyber threats.
- VPNs can be used on devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets and can be set up through software or hardware.
- VPNs typically require a subscription to a VPN service provider and may have different protocols such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and PPTP.

## **VPN PROTOCOLS**

- VPN protocols are set of rules that determine how data is transmitted over a VPN connection
- There are multiple VPN protocols available for use, each with its own set of features and security level.
- Common VPN protocols include:
    - OpenVPN: it is an open-source protocol that offers a high level of security and is widely considered to be the most secure option.
    - IKEv2: it is faster and more stable than OpenVPN, but it is less widely supported.
    - PPTP: it is an older protocol that is less secure but is easier to set up and is supported by most devices and operating systems.
    - L2TP/IPsec: it is a combination of two protocols that offers a balance of security and speed.
- The choice of protocol depends on the specific use case and the level of security required.
- It is important to note that no protocol can guarantee 100% security, hence good VPN providers should give you the ability to switch between protocols.

## **VPN TYPES**
1. Remote-access VPN: Allows a remote user to connect to a private network over the internet
2. Site-to-site VPN: Connects two private networks together over a public network (e.g. the internet)
3. Mobile VPN: Allows mobile device users to securely access a private network
4. Intranet-based VPN: Connects users within a company to the company's private network
5. Extranet-based VPN: Allows external users (e.g. business partners) to access a company's private network
6. SSL VPN: Uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to create a secure and encrypted connection
7. IPSec VPN: Uses the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol to create a secure and encrypted connection
8. PPTP VPN: Uses the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) to create a secure and encrypted connection.

## **NETWORK TYPES**

1. ### **GAN**

- Global Area Network (GAN) is not a commonly used network type, it may refer to a network that spans across multiple countries or continents.
- A GAN is typically a combination of multiple Wide Area Networks (WAN) and Local Area Networks (LAN) connected to each other via satellite links, leased lines, and other communication channels.
- A GAN can provide a global reach, allowing users to access and share resources and information from anywhere in the world.
- GANs are usually used by large organizations, such as multinational corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions, to share and exchange data among their different offices and branches.
- GANs can also be used for remote access, telecommuting, and mobile connectivity.
- Since GAN is a broad term and not an official or well defined network type, it can refer to a variety of set ups and configurations that are used to connect different networks and locations.

___

2. ### **MAN**

- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is a type of computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region, such as a city or a campus.
- A MAN typically covers an area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city or a group of buildings on a campus.
- MANs are usually owned and operated by a single entity, such as a city government, a university, or a corporation.
- They use a variety of technologies including fiber optic, Ethernet, and ATM to connect LANs and WANs.
- MANs can provide high-speed connectivity and a wide range of services such as video conferencing, data storage, and remote access to centralized resources.
- They are often used to connect different LANs in a city, allowing them to share resources and communicate with each other.
- They can also be used to connect a LAN to the Internet, providing a high-speed connection to the global network.
___

3. ### **PAN/WPAN**

- Personal Area Network (PAN) and Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) are types of computer networks that connect devices within a small area, typically within a few meters of each other.
- PANs and WPANs are used to connect personal devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and personal assistants.
- They use a variety of technologies such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, and NFC to connect devices wirelessly.
- They are often used for file transfer, printing, and syncing data between devices.
- PAN and WPAN provide a low-power and low-cost solution for connecting personal devices, without the need for a wired connection.
- WPANs are commonly used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications, where low power and low data rate devices need to be connected.
- PAN/WPAN are limited in range and are intended for small, personal use such as connecting devices on a person, in a room or in a small space.
